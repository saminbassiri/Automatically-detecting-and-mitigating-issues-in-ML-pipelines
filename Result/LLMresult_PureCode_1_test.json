    "Class Imbalance0": {"issue_detected": 1,"problematic_operators": [],"explanation": "The code does not have any explicit issue with the operators used. However, it does not handle the potential class imbalance issue. Class imbalance can significantly affect the performance of the machine learning model, especially for the classes which are under-represented. In this code, there is no step to check or handle the imbalance in the 'Income' variable which is the target variable for the prediction model. Techniques like resampling, SMOTE, or using class weights can be used to handle class imbalance."},

    "Specification Bias0": {"issue_detected": 1,"problematic_operators": ["train_test_split"],"explanation": "The train_test_split function is used before the categorical and numerical columns are defined. This could lead to specification bias as the split might not be representative of the overall data distribution. The split should be done after the pre-processing steps."},
    "Data Filtering1": {"issue_detected": 1,"problematic_operators": ["train_test_split", "drop"],"explanation": "The code is filtering data after the train-test split. This can lead to data leakage as the distribution of the training set and testing set might be different after filtering. The 'drop' operator is used to remove the 'Diabetes_binary' column from the training and testing data, which might not be appropriate if this column is important for the model training. It's recommended to perform any kind of data filtering or preprocessing before splitting the data into training and testing sets."},
