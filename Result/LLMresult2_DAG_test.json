       "problematic_operators": [],
       "explanation": "The code and DAG representation show that the train-test split is performed before any preprocessing steps, which prevents data leakage. The preprocessing pipelines are correctly applied separately to the training and test datasets. No data leakage issues are detected based on the provided code and DAG."},

       "more_info_required": 1,
       "problematic_operators": [7, 10, 13, 16],
       "explanation": "The filtering operations on 'Age' and 'HighChol' in both training and test datasets may alter the feature class distribution, potentially leading to biased model evaluations. However, the extent of this bias cannot be fully determined without additional data-related insights, such as the original distribution of these features."},
    "Data Slicing0": {
       "issue_detected": 1,
       "more_info_required": 1,
       "problematic_operators": ["1", "2"],
       "explanation": "The train_test_split operation may lead to data slicing issues if the distribution of 'score_text' or other critical features is not consistent between train and test sets. This cannot be fully determined from the code and DAG alone, as it requires insight into the data distribution."},
    "Spurious Correlations1": {
       "issue_detected": 1,
       "more_info_required": 1,
       "problematic_operators": ["feature_selection"],
       "explanation": "The feature selection step uses a RandomForestClassifier to select features based on their importance. This can lead to spurious correlations if the selected features are only coincidentally related to the target variable in the training data. Without further data insights, it's unclear if the selected features generalize well."},

       "more_info_required": 0,
       "problematic_operators": [],
       "explanation": "The code correctly splits the data into training and testing sets before fitting the model, and the preprocessing steps are applied separately to the training and test sets. There is no indication of data leakage from the code or DAG."},

       "more_info_required": 0,
       "problematic_operators": ["StandardScaler", "SelectKBest"],
       "explanation": "The preprocessing order in the pipeline applies scaling before feature selection. This can lead to suboptimal feature selection as scaling can affect the variance and distribution of features, which are often used by feature selection methods like SelectKBest. It's generally recommended to perform feature selection before scaling to ensure that the selection process is based on the original feature distributions."},

       "more_info_required": 1,
       "problematic_operators": ["0", "1", "2"],
       "explanation": "The code uses SMOTE to address class imbalance in the training data, which suggests there might be an imbalance issue. However, the DAG does not provide information about the class distribution in the dataset. Additional data insights are required to confirm if class imbalance is present in the original dataset."},

       "issue_detected": 1,
       "more_info_required": 1,
       "problematic_operators": ["Projection", "ColumnTransformer"],
       "explanation": "The code drops the 'salary' column but does not explicitly drop any potentially sensitive attributes such as 'race' or 'sex'. The DAG shows these attributes are included in the categorical columns for one-hot encoding. Without knowing the dataset's context, it's unclear if these attributes or their proxies are causing specification bias. Further data-related insights are needed to confirm if protected attributes or their proxies are inadvertently included."},

       "issue_detected": 1,
       "more_info_required": 1,
       "problematic_operators": ["-1", "-2"],
       "explanation": "The code attempts to remove proxy attributes correlated with protected attributes ('race', 'gender') by checking correlation in the training data. However, the DAG indicates unsupported operations (-1, -2) which might involve these proxy attributes. Without specific data insights, it's unclear if all proxies are effectively removed, potentially leading to specification bias."},

       "problematic_operators": ["1", "2"],
       "explanation": "The train_test_split operation (nodes 1 and 2) may lead to data slicing issues if the data distribution is not representative across train and test sets. The DAG and code do not provide enough information about the distribution of 'score_text' or other features, which could lead to biased evaluations. Additional data insights are required to confirm if the split maintains a balanced distribution of important features."},

       "problematic_operators": ["2", "4"],
       "explanation": "The data filtering operations on 'Age' and 'HighChol' may alter the distribution of the target class 'Diabetes_binary'. This could lead to biased model evaluations. However, the full impact of this filtering on class distribution cannot be determined without additional data insights."},

       "issue_detected": 1,

       "problematic_operators": ["6"],
       "explanation": "The transformation of 'native-country' to a single value 'North America' for all entries may lead to aggregation errors by losing the original granularity of the data. This can result in skewed datasets and potentially incorrect predictions. However, the full impact of this transformation cannot be determined without additional data-related insights."},

       "issue_detected": 1,
       "more_info_required": 1,
       "problematic_operators": ["spatial_aggregation"],
       "explanation": "The spatial_aggregation function modifies the 'native-country' column by grouping certain countries into 'North America'. This could lead to aggregation errors by reducing granularity and potentially skewing the dataset. However, the impact of this transformation on the model's predictions cannot be fully determined without additional data-related insights."},

       "more_info_required": 0,
       "problematic_operators": ["SelectKBest", "SMOTE"],
       "explanation": "The feature selection using SelectKBest is performed before SMOTE resampling. This can lead to suboptimal feature selection because the feature selection process is based on the original imbalanced dataset, potentially ignoring important features that could be more relevant after balancing the classes with SMOTE."}
